METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION


1- DESCRIPTION OF METHODS USED FOR COLLECTION/GENERATION OF DATA:
The original data set consisted of 153 unique published clinical trials in breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer in metastatic and non-metastatic setting from 2014-2016. 
Trials were removed from the original data set if there were any inconsistencies in the imputed patient-data as compared to its associated clinical trial, such as differing numbers of patients in the publication at-risk table and imputed data. 
The quality of the data imputation was confirmed quantitatively by calculating the Hazard Ratio using this imputed data and compared to the corresponding trial’s reported Hazard Ratio and qualitatively by overlaying the KM curve generated from the imputed data on top of the published curve. 
Trials with a Hazard Ratio difference greater than 0.1 or perceptible visual differences were removed from the final data set and not analyzed further.
